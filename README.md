# üßë‚Äçüíª Front-End & Full Stack Mini Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** mini projects! These projects helped me practice and polish my skills in frontend development. Most of them are small, single-page applications that demonstrate interactive UI components, animations, or basic logic handling ‚Äî built with **vanilla JS**, no frameworks.

> üí° One of the projects ‚Äî `Note App` ‚Äî includes backend functionality using **Flask** and **SQLite** to demonstrate full stack development.
